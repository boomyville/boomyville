# Doing things Boomarian
This is a repository of all my projects past and present.

## [Triuoomy](https://boomyville.itch.io/triuoomy)
A match 3 game with a Tetris twist. Created with gdscript in the Godot game engine. There is an upgrade system where players can gain new skills

## [Wordingo](https://boomyville.itch.io/wordingo)
A wordle clone. Created with gdscript in the Godot game engine. I made it during lockdown when Wordle was hype and the word of the day was FAVOR. Which is the wrong spelling of favour. I also changed it to become an endless game because once people completed the daily Wordle, they had to wait until the next day to play. So I added a high score table and sent it to my friends. 

## Boomarian Quest
A turn based tactics game similar to Into The Breach and Fire Emblem using the SRPG Gear MZ / SRPG Engine MV plugin system. This project will become my magnum opus. If I ever complete it. In the meantime, I have been creating javascript plugins that modify and enhance the SRPG plugin system. I have been creating turn based tactics game since I discovered SRPG Maker 95 and this is my first project to incorporate scripting. You can see snippets of my project in the readme GIFs that I have provided in the RMMV and RMMZ repositories.

## Boomy Online
A PHP / SQL / Bootstrap web browser game that I created during lockdown. A throwback to the old school browser games I used to play back in high school. This is a rewritted version of an old project of mine that replaces a lot of the mindless minigames with a fairly functional deckbuilder card battler. 

## [Optometry Business Landing Page](https://cwel.com.au)
A basic webpage I created for a fellow optometrist for their rebranding. Uses basic CSS/HTML stuff that I learnt whilst doing an online coding program.
