# Doing things Boomarian
This is a repository of all my projects past and present. I have a keen interest in game and web development. I am currently on a journey to transition from Optometry to IT.

## [Triuoomy](https://boomyville.itch.io/triuoomy)
A match 3 game with a Tetris twist. Created with gdscript in the Godot game engine. There is an upgrade system where players can gain new skills

## [Wordingo](https://boomyville.itch.io/wordingo)
A wordle clone. Created with gdscript in the Godot game engine. I made it during lockdown when Wordle was hype and the word of the day was FAVOR. Which is the wrong spelling of favour. I also changed it to become an endless game because once people completed the daily Wordle, they had to wait until the next day to play. So I added a high score table and sent it to my friends. 

## [Domino Dominion](https://github.com/boomyville/domino-dominion/)
![Demo](https://github.com/boomyville/domino-dominion/blob/main/screenRecordings/CurrentBuild.gif?raw=true)
A domino deckbuilder game made using GDScript and Godot Engine. Players build a collection of dominos and battle against enemy AI. Each played domino has various effects and the game involves a combination of strategy, planning and a little bit of RNG.

## [Card Battler](https://github.com/boomyville/Boomarian-Quest-Online)
![Demo](https://github.com/boomyville/Boomarian-Quest-Online/raw/main/Screenshots/regular_battle.gif?raw=true)
A 2020 lockdown project using PHP, Bootstrap 4, JQuery and MySQL. A fantasy collectable card battler game where players collect cards and fight monsters for rewards. Uses reCaptcha for anti-bot registration and PHPMailer for email verification. 

## [Optometry Business Landing Page](http://cwel.com.au)
![Preview of Website](https://github.com/boomyville/optometry-figma/blob/main/preview.gif?raw=true)
A basic webpage I created for a fellow optometrist for their rebranding. Uses basic CSS/HTML stuff that I learnt whilst doing an online coding program.
